## 2026-08-01 — Checkpoint 1: verified baseline

### State verification (Prompt C §1)

| State item | Expected | Observed | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prompt B audit report | exists | `/home/t0n34781/workspace/natural-flow-rag-audit.md` referenced by config; not re-audited | none |
| Natural-flow project | `/home/t0n34781/projects/natural-language-flow-rag` | present | proceed |
| File count | ~34 | 34 tracked files at baseline commit | matches |
| Unit tests | ~52 pass | 52 passed | proceed |
| Ruff | passes | `All checks passed!` | proceed |
| `pip check` | n/a | `No broken requirements found.` | proceed |
| `corpus/raw/` | no usable corpus | empty | corpus supplied by C.Walts package at CP2 |
| `var/chroma/` | unpopulated | empty directory | create collection at CP3 |
| Writes | disabled | `writes.allow_writes: false` | gate honoured until CP3 |
| `badgr_natural_flow_v1` | not populated | does not exist | create at CP3 |
| MCP server | not registered | no `.mcp.json` in project | register at CP5 |
| Similarity floor | unset | `similarity_floor: null` | measure at CP4 |
| Git repository | unknown | **NOT a git repository** | `git init` performed |
| Remote | unknown | none | private `Ch405-L9/C.Walts` created |
| Ollama | reachable | reachable; `nomic-embed-text:latest` digest `0a109f422b47` | proceed |

### Handoff package verification (Prompt D §B)

- `C.Walts_Claude_Handoff_FULL.zip` (146.6 MB) extracted to
  `/home/t0n34781/workspace/natural-flow-audit/extracted/`.
- `sha256sum -c checksums.sha256`: **22/22 OK**, including the four positive
  ElevenLabs MP3 references and the 151 MB source bundle.

### Actions

| Time | Action | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 08:4x | Extract + verify FULL package | 22/22 checksums OK |
| 08:4x | Harden `.gitignore` for media/archive/db exclusion | media, `*.zip`, `var/`, `*.sqlite3` excluded |
| 08:4x | `git init -b main`; branch `feat/natural-flow-rag-activation` | on feature branch, `main` never used as working branch |
| 08:4x | Staged-binary gate: `git ls-files --cached \| grep -iE '\.(mp3\|mp4\|m4a\|wav\|zip\|sqlite3)$'` | empty — no binaries staged |

Rollback point: the pre-existing working tree is unchanged apart from
`.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `docs/`. Deleting `.git/` returns the project
to its pre-checkpoint state.

Commit `de3bd88` — `chore: establish verified natural-flow RAG baseline`.
Pushed to `origin/feat/natural-flow-rag-activation`.
Remote `https://github.com/Ch405-L9/C.Walts` created **private** (verified via
`gh repo view --json visibility` → `PRIVATE`).

## 2026-08-01 — Checkpoint 2: corpus schema and ingestion safety

### Material placed (Prompt D §B, README §5.4)

| Destination | Files | Committed? |
|---|---|---|
| `corpus/raw/owner_examples/` | before/after pairs, positive voice references, derived reference scripts | yes (private remote, owner-owned) |
| `corpus/raw/style_rules/` | market voice-delivery rules | yes |
| `corpus/raw/evaluation/cases/` | evaluation prompts EVAL-001…015 | yes |
| `corpus/raw/evaluation/negative/` | rejected/contrast delivery descriptions | yes |
| `corpus/raw/evaluation/audio_reference_manifest.yaml` | audio manifest with hashes | yes (not ingested — YAML is not a loader-supported type) |
| `references/media/positive/` | 4 approved MP3s (3.9 MB) | **no** — gitignored, local evidence only |
| `references/transcripts/` | Theological.txt, 11labs transcript, original reference_scripts.md | **no** — gitignored, unverified/third-party provenance |
| `prompts/` | Prompt C, Prompt D, README, OWNER_DECISIONS, checksums | yes |

The 151 MB source bundle was **not** copied into the project. It stays at
`/home/t0n34781/workspace/natural-flow-audit/` and is referenced by SHA-256
`4145aa44…` in the audio manifest.

Derived file: `corpus/raw/owner_examples/approved_reference_scripts.md` contains
only SCR-001 (B. Lawson introduction) and SCR-002 (technical security passage).
The Hanna reflective passage was excluded — reconstructed from an imperfect
transcript, publication provenance unestablished, evaluation-only per the
C.Walts README limitation.

### Verified incompatibility found and fixed (narrowest change)

**Evidence.** The first dry run produced **262 chunks from 6,185 tokens** — an
average of 23 tokens per chunk, with 125 fragments from a single 1,512-word
document. Cause: the `approved_example` profile's `never_merge_separate_examples`
flag split on blank lines, so every markdown bullet became its own record. Chunks
that small cannot carry a rewrite example and would have produced meaningless
dense retrieval.

**Change.** `example_separator` added to the chunking profile contract:
`blank_line` (default, unchanged behaviour for line-oriented records such as
CMUdict) and `heading` (one record per H2 section or horizontal rule, paragraphs
inside one record packed back up to target). `approved_example` now uses
`heading`. This is the configuration change Prompt C §7 explicitly permits when
evaluation demonstrates a better setting.

**Result.** 48 chunks, 6,240 tokens, average 130 tokens per chunk. Three new
chunking tests cover both modes; 55 tests pass.

### Corpus lint (Prompt D §G1)

`scripts/corpus_lint.py` added. Result: **0 failures, 1 warning**.

| doc_type | chunks | share | class |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| approved_example | 26 | 54.2% | primary |
| evaluation_case | 17 | 35.4% | auxiliary |
| style_rule | 4 | 8.3% | primary |
| negative_pattern | 1 | 2.1% | auxiliary |

No auxiliary class exceeds the 40% cap. The single warning is
`market_voice_delivery_rules.md#3`, whose evaluation-dimension table contains the
phrase "production-ready" as scoring vocabulary — corpus text, not a claim about
this build.

### Ingestion dry run

48 chunks / 6,240 tokens / ~0.1 MiB of vectors. Single license in play:
`Proprietary — BADGRTechnologies LLC`. Manifest written to
`corpus/manifests/dryrun-20260801T124137.json`. Nothing written to the store.
